# Algorithm Visualizer

Algorithm Visualizer is an educational web-based application that bridges the gap between theoretical and practical understanding of algorithms. This project includes a dynamic frontend powered by HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and a robust backend implemented in Java with Spring Boot for enhanced functionality and scalability.
